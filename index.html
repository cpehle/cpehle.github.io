                    I am a physicist, currently working as a PostDoc as part of the <a href="https://www.structures.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php" class="link blue dim">STRUCTURES Cluster of Excellence</a> at the University of Heidelberg.

                            I study learning algorithms for spiking neural networks, with a broader interest in physical computation as well as applications of methods from physics to machine-learning. My current main interests are

                           One main result I obtained during my PhD, is an event-based analog of the backpropagation  algorithm for spiking neural networks, that computes exact gradients for arbitrary network topologies and a  large class of loss functions, overcoming the commonly held belief that spike discontinuities meant that no exact gradient with respect to parameters could be defined.

                Norse is a machine learning library I co-created for gradient-based optimization of spiking neural networks using PyTorch. It provides simple point-neuron primitives and abstractions for composing these primitives into networks. Norse was designed to be more accessible and reusable for machine-learning researchers and domain experts compared to previous work, which was often focused on abstractions familiar to computational neuroscientists or tied to a specific publication or model. For example, researchers at the European Space Agency used Norse to train and evaluate a large number of spiking neural networks for satellite image processing. Norse has now been adopted by multiple research labs, and I am continuing to co-develop the library with Jens Pedersen.

            As part of the design team for the BrainScales-2 analog neuromorphic hardware system at Heidelberg University's Electronic Vision(s) group, I worked on digital hardware design and verification, with a focus on the plasticity processing unit - an embedded microprocessor with single-instruction multiple data capabilities that enables programmable plasticity. I also maintained and extended the prototype field-programmable gate array (FPGA) interface, including the spike router and I/O unit. In addition, I was involved in three successful tapeouts of the design using TSMC's 65 nm technology. More recently, I have contributed to the machine learning-related parts of the software stack, including the PyTorch-based API, and led the redesign of our lab course for graduate students interested in working with our neuromorphic hardware system.

                I have the long term goal to develop a framework based on <em>category theory</em>, which allows for the description of self-optimizing "machines", I call "Neural Processing Elements". Those machines can be composed and nested to form larger machines. I gave a description of this research direction in chapter 2 of my <a href="https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/29866/">thesis</a>.
