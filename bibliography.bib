For the cases where this continuous part is an ordinary differential equation system (ODEs) or a linear time invariant DAE, sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the sensitivity functions are derived. Numerical computation of these sensitivity functions has been implemented as a generic functionality in a mathematical modeling environment. Special cases and application examples are used for illustration.},

	Abstract = {Recurrently connected networks of spiking neurons underlie the astounding information processing capabilities of the brain. Yet in spite of extensive research, how they can learn through synaptic plasticity to carry out complex network computations remains unclear. We argue that two pieces of this puzzle were provided by experimental data from neuroscience. A mathematical result tells us how these pieces need to be combined to enable biologically plausible online network learning through gradient descent, in particular deep reinforcement learning. This learning method--called e-prop--approaches the performance of backpropagation through time (BPTT), the best-known method for training recurrent neural networks in machine learning. In addition, it suggests a method for powerful on-chip learning in energy-efficient spike-based hardware for artificial intelligence.},

We have opted for a somewhat informal treatment of topological notions, and have omitted most proofs. Nevertheless, the exposition is sufficiently detailed to make it clear what is presently known, and to serve as a starting place for more in-depth study. Where possible, we provide pointers to more rigorous treatments in the literature. Where we include results that have only been proved in special cases, we indicate this in the form of caveats.},

	abstract = {Brains process information in spiking neural networks. Their intricate connections shape the diverse functions these networks perform. In comparison, the functional capabilities of models of spiking networks are still rudimentary. This shortcoming is mainly due to the lack of insight and practical algorithms to construct the necessary connectivity. Any such algorithm typically attempts to build networks by iteratively reducing the error compared to a desired output. But assigning credit to hidden units in multi-layered spiking networks has remained challenging due to the non-differentiable nonlinearity of spikes. To avoid this issue, one can employ surrogate gradients to discover the required connectivity in spiking network models. However, the choice of a surrogate is not unique, raising the question of how its implementation influences the effectiveness of the method. Here, we use numerical simulations to systematically study how essential design parameters of surrogate gradients impact learning performance on a range of classification problems. We show that surrogate gradient learning is robust to different shapes of underlying surrogate derivatives, but the choice of the derivative{\textquoteright}s scale can substantially affect learning performance. When we combine surrogate gradients with a suitable activity regularization technique, robust information processing can be achieved in spiking networks even at the sparse activity limit. Our study provides a systematic account of the remarkable robustness of surrogate gradient learning and serves as a practical guide to model functional spiking neural networks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	Abstract = {Brain-inspired computing seeks to develop new technologies that solve real-world problems while remaining grounded in the physical requirements of energy, speed, and size. Meeting these challenges requires high-performing algorithms that are capable of running on efficient hardware. Here, we adapt deep convolutional neural networks, which are today{\textquoteright}s state-of-the-art approach for machine perception in many domains, to perform classification tasks on neuromorphic hardware, which is today{\textquoteright}s most efficient platform for running neural networks. Using our approach, we demonstrate near state-of-the-art accuracy on eight datasets, while running at between 1,200 and 2,600 frames/s and using between 25 and 275 mW.Deep networks are now able to achieve human-level performance on a broad spectrum of recognition tasks. Independently, neuromorphic computing has now demonstrated unprecedented energy-efficiency through a new chip architecture based on spiking neurons, low precision synapses, and a scalable communication network. Here, we demonstrate that neuromorphic computing, despite its novel architectural primitives, can implement deep convolution networks that (i) approach state-of-the-art classification accuracy across eight standard datasets encompassing vision and speech, (ii) perform inference while preserving the hardware{\textquoteright}s underlying energy-efficiency and high throughput, running on the aforementioned datasets at between 1,200 and 2,600 frames/s and using between 25 and 275 mW (effectively \&gt;6,000 frames/s per Watt), and (iii) can be specified and trained using backpropagation with the same ease-of-use as contemporary deep learning. This approach allows the algorithmic power of deep learning to be merged with the efficiency of neuromorphic processors, bringing the promise of embedded, intelligent, brain-inspired computing one step closer.},

  abstract = {A supervised learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is presented that can cope with neurons that spike multiple times. The rule is developed by extending the existing SpikeProp algorithm which could only be used for one spike per neuron. The problem caused by the discontinuity in the spike process is counteracted with a simple but effective rule, which makes the learning process more efficient. Our learning rule is successfully tested on a classification task of Poisson spike trains. We also applied the algorithm on a temporal version of the XOR problem and show that it is possible to learn this classical problem using only one spiking neuron making use of a hair-trigger situation.}

	Abstract = {Author Summary It is well-known that neurons communicate with short electric pulses, called action potentials or spikes. But how can spiking networks implement complex computations? Attempts to relate spiking network activity to results of deterministic computation steps, like the output bits of a processor in a digital computer, are conflicting with findings from cognitive science and neuroscience, the latter indicating the neural spike output in identical experiments changes from trial to trial, i.e., neurons are {\^a}unreliable{\^a}. Therefore, it has been recently proposed that neural activity should rather be regarded as samples from an underlying probability distribution over many variables which, e.g., represent a model of the external world incorporating prior knowledge, memories as well as sensory input. This hypothesis assumes that networks of stochastically spiking neurons are able to emulate powerful algorithms for reasoning in the face of uncertainty, i.e., to carry out probabilistic inference. In this work we propose a detailed neural network model that indeed fulfills these computational requirements and we relate the spiking dynamics of the network to concrete probabilistic computations. Our model suggests that neural systems are suitable to carry out probabilistic inference by using stochastic, rather than deterministic, computing elements.},

	Abstract = {The experimental realization of increasingly complex synthetic quantum systems calls for the development of general theoretical methods to validate and fully exploit quantum resources. Quantum state tomography (QST) aims to reconstruct the full quantum state from simple measurements, and therefore provides a key tool to obtain reliable analytics1--3. However, exact brute-force approaches to QST place a high demand on computational resources, making them unfeasible for anything except small systems4,5. Here we show how machine learning techniques can be used to perform QST of highly entangled states with more than a hundred qubits, to a high degree of accuracy. We demonstrate that machine learning allows one to reconstruct traditionally challenging many-body quantities---such as the entanglement entropy---from simple, experimentally accessible measurements. This approach can benefit existing and future generations of devices ranging from quantum computers to ultracold-atom quantum simulators6--8.},

	Abstract = {An unresolved paradox exists in auditory and  electrosensory neural systems {Carr93,Heiligenberg91}: they  encode behaviourally relevant signals in the range of a few  microseconds with neurons that are at least one order of  magnitude slower. We take the barn owl's auditory system as  an example and present a modeling study based on computer  simulations of a neuron in the laminar nucleus. Three  observations resolve the paradox. First, spiking of an  integrate-and-fire neuron driven by excitatory postsynaptic  potentials (EPSPs) with a width at half maximum of 250  microseconds has an accuracy of 25 microseconds if the  presynaptic signals arrive coherently. Second, the  necessary degree of coherence in the signal arrival times  can be attained during ontogenetic development by virtue of  an unsupervised Hebbian learning rule. Learning selects  connections with matching delays from a broad distribution  of axons with random delays. Third, the learning rule also  selects the correct delays from two independent groups of  inputs, for example, from the left and right ear.},

	Abstract = {The λ-calculus is considered a useful mathematical tool in the study of programming languages, since programs can be identified with λ-terms. However, if one goes further and uses βη-conversion to prove equivalence of programs, then a gross simplification is introduced (programs are identified with total functions from values to values) that may jeopardise the applicability of theoretical results. In this paper we introduce calculi, based on a categorical semantics for computations, that provide a correct basis for proving equivalence of programs for a wide range of notions of computation.},

	ZÃ©lus is a new programming language for modeling systems that
	mix discrete logical time and continuous time behaviors. From a
	user's perspective, its main originality is to extend an existing
	Lustre-like synchronous language with Ordinary Differential
	Equations (ODEs). The extension is conservative: any synchronous
	program expressed as data-flow equations and hierarchical automata
	can be composed arbitrarily with ODEs in \emph{the same source code}.
	A dedicated type system and causality analysis ensure that all
	discrete changes are aligned with zero-crossing events so that no
	side effects or discontinuities occur during integration. Programs
	are statically scheduled and translated into sequential code that,
	by construction, runs in bounded time and space. Compilation is
	effected by source-to-source translation into a small synchronous
	subset which is processed by a standard synchronous compiler
	architecture. The resultant code is paired with an off-the-shelf
	numeric solver.
	We show that it is possible to build a modeler for explicit hybrid
	systems \emph{Ã  la Simulink/Stateflow} on top of an existing
	synchronous language, using it both as a semantic basis and as a
	target for code generation.

                  during simulation due to the desired operation, due
                  to failure situations or due to changes in physical
                  conditions. Corresponding models are called
                  multi-mode. We are interested in multi-domain,
                  component-oriented modeling as performed, for
                  example, with the modeling language Modelica that
                  leads naturally to Differential Algebraic Equations
                  (DAEs). This paper is thus about multi-mode DAE
                  systems. In particular, new methods are discussed to
                  overcome one key problem that was only solved for
                  specific subclasses of systems before: How to switch
                  from one mode to another one when the number of
                  equations may change and variables may exhibit
                  impulsive behavior? An evaluation is performed both
                  with the experimental modeling and simulation system
                  Modia, a domain specific language extension of the
                  programming language Julia, and with SunDAE, a novel
                  structural analysis library for multi-mode DAE
                  systems.}

	Abstract = {This paper presents verification and implementation methods that have been developed for the design of the BrainScaleS-2 65 nm ASICs. The 2nd generation BrainScaleS chips are mixed-signal devices with tight coupling between full-custom analog neuromorphic circuits and two general purpose microprocessors (PPU) with SIMD extension for on-chip learning and plasticity. Simulation methods for automated analysis and pre-tapeout calibration of the highly parameterizable analog neuron and synapse circuits and for hardware-software co-development of the digital logic and software stack are presented. Accelerated operation of neuromorphic circuits and highly-parallel digital data buses between the full-custom neuromorphic part and the PPU require custom methodologies to close the digital signal timing at the interfaces. Novel extensions to the standard digital physical implementation design flow are highlighted. We present early results from the first full-size BrainScaleS-2 ASIC containing 512 neurons and 130 K synapses, demonstrating the successful application of these methods. An application example illustrates the full functionality of the BrainScaleS-2 hybrid plasticity architecture.},

@article{selinger:2005,
	Abstract = {Dagger compact closed categories were recently introduced by Abramsky and Coecke, under the name ``strongly compact closed categories'', as an axiomatic framework for quantum mechanics. We present a graphical language for dagger compact closed categories, and sketch a proof of its completeness for equational reasoning. We give a general construction, the CPM construction, which associates to each dagger compact closed category its ``category of completely positive maps'', and we show that the resulting category is again dagger compact closed. We apply these ideas to Abramsky and Coecke's interpretation of quantum protocols, and to D'Hondt and Panangaden's predicate transformer semantics.},

	Abstractnote = {Lenses are a well-established structure for modelling bidirectional transformations, such as the interactions between a database and a view of it. Lenses may be symmetric or asymmetric, and may be composed, forming the morphisms of a monoidal category. More recently, the notion of a learner has been proposed: these provide a compositional way of modelling supervised learning algorithms, and again form the morphisms of a monoidal category. In this paper, we show that the two concepts are tightly linked. We show both that there is a faithful, identity-on-objects symmetric monoidal functor embedding a category of asymmetric lenses into the category of learners, and furthermore there is such a functor embedding the category of learners into a category of symmetric lenses.},
